Some simple implementation of [knight's tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour) algorithm(s).

- `first_try.rb` has a imperative brute force DFS
- `main.rb` is a slightly more OO approach which uses the Warnsdorff's heuristics.
- `main_test.rb` has some tests of board features (but does by far not cover everything).


The `Gemfile` is not really needed, but as the code was created on replit (to show someone else how one could do this) it was there anyway.
